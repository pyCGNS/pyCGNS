Build and Install
+++++++++++++++++

   pair: Installation; Python

   pair: Installation; hdf5
   pair: Installation; CHLone

The installation described here is for UNIX platforms only. The MS-Windows version is distributed as
a self-installable Windows package.

The installation process is easy in the case you already have the required
libraries and a standard configuration.

Required libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of the installation is to make sure you have the required
libraries. We have now a quite large set of libraries, we are trying hard to
use well known and easy to install libraries but we must admit this could
be a difficult task to install all by yourself...

The mandatory libs are *Python*, *numpy*, *HDF5* and *CHLone*, *VTK*
and *Qt*. The *cython* compiler and *scons* (for CHLone) are also required.

.. warning::

  The *libcgns* (:term:`CGNS/MLL`) is **NOT** required for pyCGNS.

The complete set of required tools/modules/libraries contains Python, HDF5
and other graphical toolkits:

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ (starting from v2.7 or v3.6)
* `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ (v1.1 +)
* `cython <http://www.cython.org>`_ (v0.19 +)
* `hdf5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org>`_ (v1.8.5 +)
* `CHLone <http://chlone.sourceforge.net>`_ (v0.39 +)
* `VTK <http://www.vtk.org>`_ (v8.0 +)
* `Qt <http://www.qt.io/downloads>`_ (v4.7 +)
* `pySide <http://www.pyside.org>`_ (v4.7 +)

The *VTK* and the *Qt* graphical toolkits need to have a Python binding.
The important point is to use the **native** Python binding of these toolkits,
not any other (see installation details hereafter). 

No Python binding is required for HDF5.

   single: CGNS/MLL
   single: CGNS/ADF
   pair: Installation; CGNS/MLL

Optional libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The so-called `mid-level` library is not mandatory, 

 * `CGNS/MLL (libcgns) <http://www.cgns.org>`_ (starting v3.0) 

Installation process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have these installed you can proceed with pyCGNS.
You go into the top directory and you edit the ``pyCGNSconfig.py.in``
(see :ref:`pycgnsconfigpyin`).
You have to set the correct paths and various values such as directory search
libs or flags.

.. index::
   single: Installation

Then you run::

  python setup.py build

and then::

  python setup.py install

or::

  python setup.py install --prefix=/local/tools/installation

All the modules of the pyCGNS package are installed and you can now
proceed with tutorial examples.

Single module installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can ask for a single module installation::

  python setup.py build --single-module=MAP
  python setup.py install

You have to check that this installation doesn't overwrite an existing
installation with the other pyCGNS modules.

.. _pycgnsconfigpyin:

Configuration file contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   pair: Installation; pyCGNSconfig_user.py

The ``pyCGNSconfig_user.py`` should work with no modification if you have
a standard installation. All you have to declare is the directory in which
we can find *Python/numpy/hdf5/CHLone/cgns* libraries.

If you have specific installations you can change some paths/flags for each
external library: *hdf5*, *numpy*. The configuration
file is a Python file, it is imported after the default configuration. The
changes you make in the configuration file will overwrite the defaults::

  # --- stuff to add for HDF5 

  #HDF5_VERSION          = ''
  HDF5_PATH_INCLUDES    = ['/home/myself/hdf5/include']
  HDF5_PATH_LIBRARIES   = ['/home/myself/hdf5/lib']
  #HDF5_LINK_LIBRARIES   = []
  #HDF5_EXTRA_ARGS       = []

To avoid overwriting, use Python to update the config::

  # --- stuff to add for HDF5 

  #HDF5_VERSION          = ''
  HDF5_PATH_INCLUDES    = ['/home/myself/hdf5/include']
  HDF5_PATH_LIBRARIES   = ['/home/myself/hdf5/lib']
  #HDF5_LINK_LIBRARIES   = []
  HDF5_EXTRA_ARGS       = HDF5_EXTRA_ARGS + ['-DMYFLAG']

You do not have to specify the VTK nor the Qt libraries, there is no direct
link to these libraries: the Python modules will do that.
  
Module dependancies
-------------------

The pyCGNS modules have dependancies with their brothers. The list below
gives you the required modules (or optional) for each of them.

 - MAP : None
 - PAT : MAP
 - APP : PAT MAP
 - NAV : PAT MAP APP

NAV depends
~~~~~~~~~~~
The CGNS.NAV tool uses two graphical toolkits, one for the GUI (Qt) and another
one for the graphical view window (VTK). The VTK toolkit must have its
Python binding installed. You should not use `pyVTK` but the native Python
binding of VTK. To do so, edit the VTK configuration file to set the Python
wrapping and all associated paths. And example of production could be::

  cd VTK
  mkdir B
  cd B
  cmake ..

Then edit the `CMakeCache.txt` file::

  //Wrap VTK classes into the Python language.
  VTK_WRAP_PYTHON:BOOL=ON

And build/install...

The Qt toolkit is used with the qtpy package and provides support for PyQt5 or PySide Python bindings, which are official
binding with this langage. You can check you have the 
correct bindings by typing::

  python
  >>>import vtk
  >>>import qtpy

Both should not fail...

MAP depends
~~~~~~~~~~~

The embedded *CHLone* library is required and thus *HDF5* is required.

CGNS/MLL
~~~~~~~~~~~

*CGNS/MLL* and *CGNS/ADF* libraries are required.
Set the following variable to ``ON`` in the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file::

 
 //Build the CGNSTools package
 BUILD_CGNSTOOLS:BOOL=ON

 //Build a shared version of the library
 CGNS_BUILD_SHARED:BOOL=ON

 //Enable or disable the use of Fortran
 ENABLE_FORTRAN:BOOL=ON

 //Enable or disable HDF5 interface
 ENABLE_HDF5:BOOL=ON

The NAV module (and CHLone by the way) is using cython. You can
check your cython is present using::

   cython --version

That should not fail...

.. _testsupport:

Test
++++

Some of the pyCGNS modules have embedded tests. Once you have installed
pyCGNS, you can run each test suite from another user account/directory::

  python -c 'import CGNS.MAP.test;CGNS.MAP.test.run()'

All modules tests can be run the same way, replace ``MAP`` by any of
``PAT``, ``VAL``, ``NAV``, ``APP``, ``DAT``. You can run all the
tests by importing ``CGNS.test``::

  python -c 'import CGNS.PAT.test;CGNS.PAT.test.run()'

  python -c 'import CGNS.test'

The tests are running silently, if there is a problem you would see a stack
error on the output.
